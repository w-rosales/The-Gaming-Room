# The-Gaming-Room

The client for this program was "The Gaming Room". The intent for the software design was to be able to support multiple teams and players while keeping them both unique.
The Gaming Room wanted the user to be able to customize their experience and for the software to recognize each player's unique ID.
This is all through a matter of making a web-based version of their previously existing Android application.

Throughout the documentation of this software, I made it clear to state articulated recommendations, constraints, and explanations to the stakeholders of The Gaming Room.
The document that explains the software design is able to teach the stakeholders more about what the possibilities are in expanding their application to different software platforms.

The documentation is able to help clarify the expectations and requirements that are needed in the design of the application.
By listing the requirements, design constraints, and UML Diagram we are able to develop our code knowing the structure from the previous application. 
Considering that the Gaming Room wants to make this application accessible among several software platforms, the structure would mostly remain the same throughout the course of development.

I believe that the evaluation side where I explain the differences between Mac, Linux, Windows, and Mobile Devices platforms could have been revised. This section of the document should be easier to understand for stakeholders and should include much more information in greater detail. 
For improvement beyond just detail, I could have expanded the list to separate Mobile Devices to Apple and Android in to separate categories. There are many differences between the development process and structure of code when it comes to just these two software platforms.
Instead of cramming the detailed information all under one category, I would want to showcase information separately about these two very popular software platforms.

I interpreted the user's needs by understanding what makes the application unique. In this case, it was the customization of their ID and being able to connect in various platforms. 
It was important to consider the user's needs since it ensures the end product aligns with the expectations from the previous android application.

The design in software would mostly come from commmunication with the client. In the end, this is not a product that I am making for myself, but instead for a client. 
I must understand the wants and needs, and provide suggestions on improvements based on that. Clarification on the expectation of the product will be an essential part of the development process, which this would mean to design software that will also be able to be scalable and adaptable for future needs.
